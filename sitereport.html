                <h1>BASICS</h1>
                <p>From the start, we learned the most basics by using HTML and CSS.
                    It was simple at start however as the teacher starting teaching more codes,<br>it 
                    was confusing and I started facing difficulties.By applying the codes repeatedly 
                    on Visual Studio Code, I was able to remember and understand<br>the codes easily.
                    At the same time, while using the Studio Code, I was able to try out different type 
                    of codes and seeing changes.This allowed me<br>to further learn more during my own time.
