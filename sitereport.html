                <h1>BASICS</h1>
                <p>From the start, we learned the most basics by using HTML and CSS.
                    It was simple at start however as the teacher started teaching us with more codes,<br>it 
                    was confusing and I started facing difficulties.However by applying the codes repeatedly 
                    on Visual Studio Code, I was able to remember and understand<br>them easily.
                    At the same time, while using the Studio Code, I was able to try out different type 
                    of codes that showed me different results everytime.This allowed me<br>to further self learn more.
                    While doing up my web page for the assignment, along the way I faced lots of problems.
                    Upon fixing the problems that<br>I came along, I came to notice that small details could affect the
                    overall coding.For instance, when it comes to css, the spacing between<br>the element and
                    tag could vary the impact on the coding.
