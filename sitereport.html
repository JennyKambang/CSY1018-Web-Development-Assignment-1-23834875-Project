                <h1>BASICS</h1>
                <p>From the start, we learned the most basics by using HTML and CSS.
                    It was simple at start however as the teacher started teaching us with more codes,<br>it 
                    was confusing and I started facing difficulties.However by applying the codes repeatedly 
                    on Visual Studio Code, I was able to remember and understand<br>them easily.
                    At the same time, while using the Studio Code, I was able to try out different type 
                    of codes that showed me different results everytime.This allowed me<br>to further self learn more.
                    While doing up my web page for the assignment, along the way I faced lots of problems.
                    Upon fixing the problems that I came along,<br>I came to notice that small details could affect the
                    overall coding.For instance, when it comes to css, the spacing between the element and
                    tag could vary the impact<br>on the coding.I have learned and came to a realisation that in order for me to be able
                    to further do higher up codings and designs for web, the foundation which is the<br>basics of web must be
                    fully understood as well as be wary of any mistakes that comes along the way when coding.Furthermore, I learned that
                    when coding is involved,<br>there are also others to keep in mind.For example, using of github to save any progress made
                    incase any losses are made.Hence, I came to a conclusion that there are many<br>important primary points to look into when coding.
                    So I am more or less doomed in the future.
